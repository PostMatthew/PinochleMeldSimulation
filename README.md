# Hey Team,

This is a repo for my Pinochle Meld hand simulation built for Math 335: Probability.

I built this notebook as a final project for my probability course senior fall. This notebook makes use of Bayes Theorem as a means to explore the likelhood of getting intresting hands of meld.

Enjoy,
MCP
